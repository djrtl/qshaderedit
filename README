INTRODUCTION

QShaderEdit is a simple multiplatform shader editor inspired by Apple's OpenGL Shader 
Builder.

It supports ARB programs, GLSL shaders and CgFx effects.


REQUIREMENTS

You will need at least:

* Qt 4.4, recommended Qt4.5
* GLEW 1.3
* cmake 2.4

Optionally, if the Cg (1.4 or above) runtime is found, support for CgFx effects will be 
available.

INSTALLATION

I use cmake as the build system. To build the sources, run cmake on the source directory, 
that will generate native makefiles or projects. For example, on unix platforms you have
to run make.

$ cmake && make

or

1.qmake
2.make
3.sudo make install

For more info about cmake, look at cmake's documentation.
