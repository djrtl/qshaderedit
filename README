INTRODUCTION

QShaderEdit is a simple multiplatform shader editor inspired by Apple's OpenGL Shader 
Builder.

It supports GLSL shaders and CgFx effects.

This is an early release, there are bugs and many missing features.


REQUIREMENTS

You will need at least:

* Qt 4.1
* GLEW 1.3
* cmake 2.4

Optionally, if the Cg runtime is found, support for CgFx effects will be available.


DOWNLOAD

INSTALLATION

I use cmake as the build system. To build the sources, run cmake on the source directory, 
that will generate native makefiles or projects. For example, on unix platforms you have
to run make.

$ cmake && make

For more info about cmake, look at cmake's documentation.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

The windows binaries sometimes crash when opening cgfx effects due to some strange error 
involving timers and threads.
